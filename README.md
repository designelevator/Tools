# Tools

In leading innovation processes, through human center design approach, we had sometimes the need to create diverse tools.   In this repository you will find 2 of them:

–– Voting heads. 
It is inspired from Lego figures heads, and is a tool we use for voting during sprints and workshops. There are cases where we also used specific colours for external people joining the workshop for the day, or top management. 

–– Roland GS-24 pen adapter
This is a simple print in place 3d print you may use to replace the knife with a pen on your vinyl cutting plotter. We created this as to be able to rapidly create templates for activities, as it did not made sense to us to purchase a large format printer for this purpose given the ink might dry and cause expensive repairs.
